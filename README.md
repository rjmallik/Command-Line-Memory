The project involves developing a command-line tool in C that enables efficient and robust file management through "get" and "set" operations. The tool reads commands from standard input to either retrieve and display the contents of a file or create/update a file with specified content. It handles errors gracefully, such as invalid commands or file access issues, and ensures robust memory and file descriptor management to prevent leaks. The implementation emphasizes performance, using buffered I/O for efficiency and limiting memory usage to a defined maximum. Additionally, it incorporates input flexibility, processing varying content lengths accurately, and adheres to strict Linux filesystem conventions for file naming and operations.
